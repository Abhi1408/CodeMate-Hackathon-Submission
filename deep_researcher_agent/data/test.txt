Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns.
Human activities, especially burning fossil fuels, increase greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
Consequences include sea-level rise, more extreme weather, and impacts on biodiversity.
Research continues to explore mitigation and adaptation strategies.
