📚 Deep Researcher Agent

An AI-powered local research assistant that can ingest documents, generate embeddings, retrieve relevant chunks, reason over queries, and synthesize concise answers — all without external APIs.

🚀 Hosted Demo: https://appapppy-ajgfqs7wrdhmpqjcwsteo6.streamlit.app/

✨ Features

🔍 Local Embeddings
Uses SentenceTransformers (if available) or TF-IDF fallback for lightweight vector search.

📝 Multi-File Ingestion
Supports .txt, .md, .pdf, and .docx. Upload documents and instantly build an index.

🧩 Chunking + Indexing
Splits long documents into overlapping word chunks for efficient retrieval.

🧠 Multi-Step Reasoning
Complex queries are decomposed into sub-queries with transparent reasoning traces.

📑 Synthesis & Citations
Extractive summarization of top chunks, with confidence scores and file-based citations.

📤 Export Reports
Download answers + reasoning as structured Markdown files.

💡 Interactive UI
Built with Streamlit — intuitive, upload files, ask questions, refine queries.

🏆 Hackathon Notes

This project was built for the CodeMate Hackathon under the “Deep Researcher Agent” track.
Key challenge: perform research-style document retrieval and reasoning using only local embeddings.
